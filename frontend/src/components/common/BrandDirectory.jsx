            <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Get your hands on exciting deals and rewards with the Flipkart SuperCoin program. It is a Flipkart loyalty program that offers reward points in the form of SuperCoins every time you shop. Think of them as digital rewards currency. (e.g., ₹100 spent = 2 SuperCoin). Flipkart Plus members can earn up to 25 coins with every purchase. You can use your accumulated <a href="#" className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">SuperCoins</a> like cash during checkout. With cashback offers offering you 1 SuperCoin for every rupee spent, you earn as you spend. You can redeem them when you check out products on Flipkart, SuperCoin Zone for offers and gift cards, subscriptions to access OTT platforms, music services, or Flipkart Plus partner perks and services. You can redeem supercoins to get additional offers and discounts at Flipkart and partner merchants.
